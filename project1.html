            <h1>Haoting Gao's first project: Egret Station</h1>
            <p>
            <br>Chengdu Electric Power Fitting Factory used to be situated in the outskirts of the city, yet it is currently enclosed by busy downtown area. Since the factory relocated to the place far away from city centre, the original site has been derelict for 18 years, waiting to be converted. When I conducted an on-site investigation, I noticed that fIying white egrets were in stark contrast with the construction waste. The egrets survived in this abandoned building.  When I saw the egrets standing on the beams of the ruins of the building, I thought I should do something for them. So I redesigned the site to make it suitable for egrets.
            <br><br>After researching the habitat of the egret, I determined to conserve the post-industrial brownfield. I aim to restore this area to the dwelling of egrets, while retaining the characteristics of a post-industrial society. Egrets can search for a habitat in a city filled with skyscrapers. Egrets generally select farmland, fish ponds, rivers, shoals, and other areas with large areas of open water as feeding grounds. The foraging ground of the egret needs to be more than 60m away from the artificial disturbance and less than 2000m away from the habitat. Egrets prefer wide forest belts with gentle slopes, high vegetation density as their habitat, which are close to bright water surface and Sancha River estuary and far away from artificial disturbances.
